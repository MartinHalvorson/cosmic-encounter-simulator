# Cosmic Encounter Simulator

(This is a relatively old project from about ~ 5 years ago)

Cosmic Encounter is a strategy board game where players take turns going on encounters in attempt to control other player's planets. Each player takes on an alien power at the start of the game, which allows them to modify some aspect of play. This simulator models the game of Cosmic Encounter with various alien powers. 

Basic Rules (copied from the Reference section of the Cosmic Encounter Rulebook - https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/11/c6/11c61988-bb60-428f-b614-9c3a952f070b/cosmic-encounter-rulebook.pdf):

###### _Note: This table just shows win rates. The absolute power is proportional to the win rate adjusted for the number of players in the game. (Individual player win rates will generally go down the more players in the game.)_

This table shows how the absolute strength of each power changes based on the number of players in the game. Generally speaking, powers with "main player" interactions decrease in strength with more players in the game. Powers with "all player" or "per turn" or "not main player" interactions grow in strength the more players in the game.
